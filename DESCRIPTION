Description: A method that allows for the use of a collection of non-matched
    normal tissue samples. Our approach uses a non-parametric bootstrap
    subsampling of the available reference samples to estimate the distribution
    of read counts from targeted sequencing. As inspired by random forest, this
    is combined with a procedure that subsamples the amplicons associated with 
    each of the targeted genes. The obtained information allows us to reliably 
    classify the copy number aberrations on the gene level.
