\title{
  BootList
}
\description{
    Performs a hybrid bootstrapping subsampling
    procedure similar to random forest. Returns
    a distribution of sample/reference ratios for
    each gene and sample of interest combination.
}
\usage{
    BootList(geneNames, sampleMatrix, refmat, replicates)
}
\arguments{
  \item{geneNames}{
     A vector of the gene names used in the panel.
}
  \item{sampleMatrix}{
     A vector or matrix of the read counts from the sample of interest.
     In the case of a matrix columns represent samples and rows amplicons.
}
  \item{refmat}{
     A matrix of the read counts obtianed from the reference samples.
     Columns represent reference samples and rows amplicons.
}
  \item{replicates}{
     How many bootstrap replicates should be performed.
}

}

\value{

 Returns a list of numeric matrices:
 For each matrix a row represent a gene while each column represents
 bootstrapping subsampling iteration.
