\textbf{Abstract}
\end{center}
This paper describes the use of an R bioconductor package to use targeted sequencing data to reliably detect CNVs from clinical samples. To assess how reliable a change in reads counts in a specific region correlates with the presence of CNVs we implemented an algorithm which uses a subsampling strategy similar to Random Forest to predict the presence of reliable CNVs. We also introduce a novel method to correct for the background noise introduced by sequencing genes with a low number of amplicons. We describe the implementation of these models in the package \textbf{CNVPanelizer} and illustrate its usage to reliably detect CNVs on several simulation and real data examples including several code snippets when dealing with clinical data. For a more complete overview of the package's functionality and extensibility see TODO Wolf and Cristiano (2015)....., the manual pages and the reference card.

\section*{\Large Introduction}
Targeted sequencing, over the last few years, has become a mainstay in the clinical use of next generation sequencing technologies \cite{Glockle2014}. For the detection of somatic and germline SNPs this has been proven to be a highly robust methodology \cite{Huang2013}. One area of genomic analysis which is usually not covered by targeted sequencing, is the detection of copy number variations (CNVs). While a large number of available algorithms and software address the problem of CNV detection in whole genome or whole exome sequencing, there are no such established tools for targeted sequencing.

\section*{\Large Methods}
To assess how reliable a change in reads counts in a specific region correlates with the presence of CNVs, we implemented an algorithm which uses a subsampling strategy similar to Random Forest to predict the presence of reliable CNVs. We also introduce a novel method to correct for the background noise introduced by sequencing genes with a low number of amplicons.

\section*{\Large Implementation}
We could reproduce the CNVs detected by Exome sequencing and detected CNVs were also found on the Exome level. The CNVs detected by our approach but not by the Exome data were validated by a Taqman assay.

\section*{\Large Using}
This section provides an overview of the package functions, with selected illustrative simulation experiments which describes the typical usage of the package available functions.

\subsection*{Installing and Loading the package}

The package is available through the Bioconductor repository and could be installed using the following R command:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## TODO Not this, but some bioconductor thing...
library(CNVPanelizer)

##source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
##biocLite("CNVPanelizer")

```

\subsection*{Importing data}

We provide some helper functions to make the import of data more straightforward. (For testing purposes we also provide a sample data set)

\subsection*{Using test data}

We made use of two synthetically generated data sets.
One was generated using binomial distributions while
the other one follows a Poisson distribution.

```{r}
# TODO Change data
#data(ALL, package = "CNVPanelizer")

```

\subsection*{Using real data}

```{r}

# Directory with the test data
sampleDirectory <- "D:/data/NGS/test"

# Directory with the reference data
referenceDirectory <- "D:/data/NGS/reference"

# vector with test filenames
sampleFilenames <- list.files(path = sampleDirectory,
                              pattern = ".bam$",
                              full.names = TRUE)

# vector with reference filenames
referenceFilenames <- list.files(path = referenceDirectory,
                                 pattern = ".bam$",
                                 full.names = TRUE)

```

\subsubsection*{Loading BED data}

```{r}

# Bed file defining the amplicons
bedFilepath <- "D:/data/NGS/LCPv1(CNV).bed"

# The Column number at the BED file where the amplicon column names are
ampliconColumnNumber <- 4

# Extract the information from a bed file
genomicRangesFromBed <- BedToGenomicRanges(bedFilepath,
                                           ampliconColumn = ampliconColumnNumber,
                                           split = "_")

metadataFromGenomicRanges <- elementMetadata(genomicRangesFromBed)
geneNames = metadataFromGenomicRanges["geneNames"][, 1]
ampliconNames = metadataFromGenomicRanges["ampliconNames"][, 1]


```

\subsubsection*{Counting Reads}

The reads were counted using the ExomeCopy [] package from the Bioconductor project \cite{Gentleman2004}. All reads overlapping with the region of an amplicon were counted for this amplicon. Only reads with a Mapping quality $\geq 20$ were counted. The read count information obtained from a BAM file can be represented as a read count matrix $C_{mn}$ with each column for a sample from the sample set $S = s_1,\ldots,s_n$ and each row for an amplicon from the set of amplicons $A = a_1,\ldots,a_m$. Each amplicon $a_{m,g}$ is associated with a specific gene $A_G; G = g_1,\ldots,g_k$. A read count matrix was generated for both the references $C_R$ and the samples on which the CNV calling is to be performed $C_S$. 
The function implemented in the ExomeCopy package allows to remove PCR Duplicates. For reads with the same start site, end site and chromosomal
orientation only one is kept. As shown in [] PCR duplicates do not have a large influence on the ratio between reference and sample.
Still this might serve as an additional quality control step in a CNV detection pipeline.  


```{r}

# Should duplicated reads (same start, end site and strand) be removed
removePcrDuplicates <- TRUE

# Read the Reference data set
referenceReadCounts <- ReadCountsFromBam(referenceFilenames,
                                         sampleNames = referenceFilenames,
                                         genomicRangesFromBed,
                                         ampliconNames = ampliconNames,
                                         removeDup = removePcrDuplicates)

# Read the sample data set
sampleReadCounts <- ReadCountsFromBam(sampleFilenames,
                                      sampleNames = sampleFilenames,
                                      genomicRangesFromBed,
                                      ampliconNames = ampliconNames,
                                      removeDup = removePcrDuplicates)

```

\subsection*{Normalization}

To account for sample and sequencing run specific variations the counts obtained for each sample were normalized. After calculating the median read count over all amplicons for each sample, all samples were normalized to the same median read count using the cnMops Bioconductor package. Both reference ($C_R$) and samples ($C_S$) were  normalized together, to allow for an unbiased comparison. This resulted in the normalized matrices $\bar{C}_S$  and $\bar{C_S}$. The normalized read counts are referred to as median normalized read count (MNR) values. In the following text all notations will refer to the normalized values.

```{r}

normalizedReadCounts <- CombinedNormalizedCounts(sampleReadCounts,
                                                 referenceReadCounts,
                                                 genomicRangesFromBed,
                                                 amplicons = ampliconNames)


```


\subsection*{CNV detection}

As a matching normal reference is not always available in clinical sequencing \cite{Gerstung2014}, a synthetic reference is generated by averaging (median) the amplicon read counts over all available reference samples. The synthetic reference can be represented as vector of averaged reference read counts $\hat{c}_R = \hat{c}_{R,1,1},\ldots,\hat{c}_{R,m,g}$. 
If  the reference was obtained from tumor samples instead of normal tissue, a weighting scheme can be used. Each sample is weighted by the inverse interquartile range of the read counts over all amplicons. Thus samples showing an increased level of chromosomal instability receive a lower weight. This can be used to calculate a weighted median or to assign a lower weight to such samples in following subsampling procedures. The read counts for the samples of interest can also be represented as vectors  $c_S = c_1,\ldots,c_n  = c_{S,1,1},\ldots,c_{S,m,g}$. The ratio between synthetic reference and a sample can be calculated as $r_{SR} = \frac{c_S}{c_R}$. After calculating the median read counts for each  amplicon, these are averaged (median) for each of the analysed genes $r_{SRG} = median(r_{SRa};a \in A_G)$  Thus obtaining a read count score for each gene. The set of genes with significant changes. While this gives an estimate of the ratios it does not take into consideration the distribution over the reference samples and the variance between the amplicons.





\subsection*{Bootstrap based analysis}

Aproach similar to the Random forest or Random k-nearest neighbour methodologies, which bootstrap the samples and subsample the features. In our case features would be equivalent to amplicons. The subsampling procedure is repeated n times to generate a large set of randomized synthetic references $B = b_1,\ldots,b_n$ by selecting with replacement (boostrapping) from the set of reference samples. The ratio between the sample of interest and each randomized reference is calculated for each gene, using only a subset of the amplicons associated with each gene.

```{r}

# After normalization data sets need to be splitted again to perform bootstrap
samplesNormalizedReadCounts = normalizedReadCounts["samples"][[1]]
referenceNormalizedReadCounts = normalizedReadCounts["reference"][[1]]

```

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Number of bootstrap replicates to be used
replicates <- 10

# perform the bootstrap based analysis
bootList <- BootList(geneNames,
                     samplesNormalizedReadCounts,
                     referenceNormalizedReadCounts,
                     reps = replicates,
                     refWeights = NULL)

```

\subsection*{Background estimation}

Not all genes have the same number of amplicons $|A_G|$ and it has been shown that sequencing genes with a higher number of amplicons  yields better sensitivity and specifity when detecting putative copy number variations. Still genes sequenced with a low number of amplicons might still show significant changes in observed read counts. While normalization makes the comparison of read counts comparable between samples, genes with a small number of amplicons might still show a bias. To quantify the effect of a low number of amplicons on the calling of CNVs we introduced a background noise estimation procedure. Using the ratio between the median reference and the sample used for calling we subsample for each unique number of amplicons. In the case of two amplicons we repeatedly sample two random amplicons from the set of all amplicons, and average the ratios. Amplicons that belong to genes showing significant copy number variations $G_{sig}$ are not included in the subsampling pool.
Each amplicon is weighted according to the number of amplicons the respective gene has $w_A = \frac{1}{|A_g|}$. Thus the probablity of sampling from a gene is the same regardless of the number amplicons. For each number of amplicons a background noise distribution is estimated. The background reported is defined by $5\%$ and the $95\%$ of the respective distribution. For each unique number of amplicons per gene we run a sampling based approach to estimate the background noise after normalization. While normalization works well for genes with a large number of amplicons, background noise still remains for gene with only a few measured amplicons. The correlation between background error and number of amplicons is shown in figure X.

 
```{r}

# Get the most significance genes
sigList = CheckSignificance(bootList)

# estimate the background noise left after normalization
backgroundNoise <- Background(geneNames,
                              samplesNormalizedReadCounts,
                              referenceNormalizedReadCounts,
                              sigList,
                              replicates = replicates)

```

\subsection*{Report tables}

The report includes a barplot with the bootstrap dis-
tribution for each gene. An example can be found in
figure X The final report is genewise, and is based on
the bootstrapping It reports how often the ratio was
above/below a certain value: i.e 70
 
```{r}

# Build report tables
reportTables <- ReportTables(bootList, 
                             geneNames, 
                             backgroundNoise, 
                             referenceNormalizedReadCounts, 
                             samplesNormalizedReadCounts)

```

\subsection*{Results}
 
```{r}

# Directory where the generated files with the analysis results will be saved.
outputDirectory <- "D:/data/NGS/CNVPanelizerResults"

# Export the report tables to excel format
reportTablesFilepath <- file.path(outputDirectory, "report_tables.xlsx")
WriteListToXLSX(reportTables, reportTablesFilepath)

# # Export read counts to excel format
readCountsFilepath <- file.path(outputDirectory, "readCounts.xlsx")
normalizedReadCountsFilepath <- file.path(outputDirectory, "normalizedReadCounts.xlsx")

To make it easier to develop real use scripts we added some helper methods to the package:

\section*{\Large Reading data from files}


```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Read the Reference data set
referenceFilenames <- list.files(path = referenceDirectory,
                                 pattern = ".bam$",
                                 full.names = TRUE)
referenceReadCounts <- ReadCountsFromBam(referenceFilenames,
                                         sampleNames = referenceFilenames,
                                         genomicRangesFromBed,
                                         ampliconNames = ampliconNames,
                                         removeDup = removePcrDuplicates)
```


\section*{\Large Saving data to files}

The format of the data is chosen Depending on the file extension (xls for Excel and xlsx for Excel2007). We advice using the xlsx format (based on Office Open XML format) to keep compatibility with other tools
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Export the report tables to excel format
reportTablesFilepath <- file.path(outputDirectory, "report_tables.xlsx")
WriteListToXLSX(reportTables, reportTablesFilepath)

```

And for plotting data, generating one plot per test sample

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Export the plots (generates one plot per sample)
PlotBootstrapDistributions(bootList, reportTables, outputDirectory)

```


\section*{\Large Summary}

We introduced a novel algorithm for the reliable detection of CNV from targeted sequencing.
On Synthetic Dataset the algorithm performed with a high AUC up to a level of noise. On Real Data The concordance between targeted sequencing and
whole exome data was high. Removal of PCR duplicates resulted in a signicantly lower rate of false positive detections.

\section*{\large Preface}
     Academic literature uses the abstract to succinctly communicate complex research. An abstract may act as a stand-alone entity instead of a full paper. As such, an abstract is used by many organizations as the basis for selecting research that is proposed for presentation in the form of a poster, platform/oral presentation or workshop presentation at an academic conference. Most literature database search engines index only abstracts rather than providing the entire text of the paper. Full texts of scientific papers must often be purchased because of copyright and/or publisher fees and therefore the abstract is a significant selling point for the reprint or electronic form of the full text.
